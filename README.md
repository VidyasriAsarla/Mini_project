Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning 

Recommending products based on user interest is one of the principal tasks in business. It can be
achieved using machine learning. Movie recommendation system aims at helping movie enthusiasts
to reduce the human effort by suggesting movies based on userâ€™s interest in efficient and effective
manner without wasting much time in useless browsing. This document focuses on a model
combining both cosine similarity and sentiment analysis to develop a movie recommender system.
Cosine similarity is a standard used to measure similarity of two items. Sentiment analysis of a movie
review can figure how positive or negative a movie review is and thus the overall rating for a movie.
Therefore, the process of understanding of a review is positive or negative can be automated as the
machine learns through training and testing the data. It will give progressively explicit outcomes
compared to different systems that are based on content-based approach. Hence, we have focused on
a system that resolves these issues.
